# Pheno-Geno-Predictor

##JavaFX Application

**About**
-This a basic implementation of a JavaFX GUI which accepts the users basic genetic traits as inputs and displays
 a simple output which shows the possible genetic scenarios and the most probable scenario.

-The user inputs are processed in a slightly primitive way. This application is to be improvised by using a
 SQL Databse which enable the possiblity of providing a large assorment of options to choose from for the user.
 Along with this each independent ouput can be analysed further for a more conclusive output combining all and 
 showing a single, most-probable combination of genetic traits.
 
**Implementation**
 
 -The UI is implemented using fxml and JavaFX Scene Builder.

-The Project has been built on OpenJDK 11 and JavaFX 11.
